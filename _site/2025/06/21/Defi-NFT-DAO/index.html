<h2 id="1-defi-decentralized-finance-banking-without-banks">1. DeFi (Decentralized Finance): Banking Without Banks</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-defi">What is DeFi?</h3>

<p><strong>DeFi</strong> is short for ‘Decentralized Finance.’ As the name suggests, it refers to the entire ecosystem of financial systems that operate on the blockchain via smart contracts, <strong>without traditional financial intermediaries</strong> like banks or brokerage firms.</p>

<h3 id="how-is-it-possible">How is it possible?</h3>

<p>Everything is automated by smart contracts. Financial activities like lending, borrowing, earning interest, and exchanging assets are processed automatically by code, 24/7, without human intervention. Users simply connect their personal cryptocurrency wallets to a DeFi service to participate.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-use-cases">Real-World Use Cases</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lending/Borrowing</strong>: On platforms like ‘Compound’ or ‘Aave,’ you can deposit your crypto to earn interest, often at higher rates than a traditional bank. Conversely, you can use your crypto as collateral to borrow other crypto assets. The entire process is executed automatically by smart contracts.</li>
  <li><strong>Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)</strong>: ‘Uniswap’ is a prime example. It allows users to swap cryptocurrencies directly with each other (P2P) through smart contracts, without a central server or authority managing the trades.</li>
</ul>

It’s a <strong>‘24/7 automated financial plaza’</strong> open to everyone.</p>

<h2 id="2-nft-non-fungible-token-a-one-of-a-kind-digital-certificate">2. NFT (Non-Fungible Token): A One-of-a-Kind Digital Certificate</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-an-nft">What is an NFT?</h3>

<p><strong>NFT</strong> stands for ‘Non-Fungible Token.’ The key phrase here is <strong>‘non-fungible.’</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fungible</strong>: My $10 bill has the same value as your $10 bill, and they are interchangeable. One Bitcoin is identical to another Bitcoin.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-Fungible</strong>: However, Leonardo da Vinci’s original ‘Mona Lisa’ is one of a kind and cannot be replaced by any other painting.</li>
</ul>

<p>An NFT is like the ‘Mona Lisa’ of the digital world. It’s a <strong>‘digital certificate of ownership’ that assigns a unique identifier to a digital file (like an image, video, or song) to prove it is the one-and-only original.</strong></p>

<h3 id="how-is-it-possible-1">How is it possible?</h3>

<p>A smart contract is used to link a specific digital file and its owner’s information, recording it on the blockchain. This record is immutable and cannot be forged, clearly proving who the true owner is.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-use-cases-1">Real-World Use Cases</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Digital Art</strong>: The most famous example is the artist ‘Beeple,’ whose NFT artwork sold for millions. The buyer purchased the ‘original ownership’ of the file, not just the image itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Game Items</strong>: You can own a rare sword or character in a blockchain game as an NFT. This remains your asset even if the game shuts down, and you can sell it to others.</li>
  <li><strong>Memberships/Tickets</strong>: An exclusive online community or offline party can grant access only to holders of a specific NFT, which acts as a special membership pass.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-dao-decentralized-autonomous-organization-an-organization-without-a-ceo">3. DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization): An Organization Without a CEO</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-a-dao">What is a DAO?</h3>

<p><strong>DAO</strong> is an acronym for ‘Decentralized Autonomous Organization.’ It is an internet-native organization that operates <strong>without a central leader or CEO, run by its members who make collective decisions through voting, based on a set of rules encoded in smart contracts.</strong></p>

<h3 id="how-is-it-possible-2">How is it possible?</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Governance Tokens</strong>: Members of a DAO hold ‘governance tokens,’ which are cryptocurrencies that represent voting power. The more tokens you hold, the more influence you have.</li>
  <li><strong>Proposals and Voting</strong>: Any member can submit a proposal, such as “Let’s invest our treasury funds in Project A.” All token holders then vote to approve or reject the proposal.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic Execution</strong>: If a vote passes, the outcome is automatically executed by the organization’s smart contracts. No human approval or intervention is needed.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="real-world-use-cases-2">Real-World Use Cases</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Protocol DAOs</strong>: The DeFi service ‘Uniswap,’ mentioned earlier, is governed by a DAO. Holders of the Uniswap token (UNI) vote on things like fee structure changes and protocol upgrades.</li>
  <li><strong>Investment DAOs</strong>: A group of people pools their money and votes on which NFTs or startups to invest in. All investment activities and funds are transparently managed on the blockchain.</li>
  <li><strong>Social DAOs</strong>: Communities for people with shared interests who collectively plan activities and manage a budget.</li>
</ul>

It’s a <strong>‘transparent and democratic digital cooperative.’</strong></p>

<p>While DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs may seem like separate concepts, they are often intertwined and create synergies. For example, a DAO could govern a DeFi protocol that allows you to take out a loan using an NFT as collateral. These three are the core building blocks of the new internet being built on blockchain technology: <strong>Web3</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-ask">The Ask</h2>

<p>My friend asked if there was a service that could read academic papers aloud - not like NotebookLM which creates podcast-style summaries, but something that would actually read the original text. She wanted to listen to papers like audiobooks when her eyes got tired.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt know of such a service, but since I‚Äôm familiar with Microsoft Azure Language Services, I offered to help: ‚ÄúSend me the paper and I‚Äôll make mp3 for you.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="the-reality-check">The Reality Check</h2>

<p>I thought this would be simple:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Extract text from PDF using Claude/ChatGPT/Grok</li>
  <li>Run it through Azure TTS (Text to Speech)</li>
  <li>Done!</li>
</ol>

<p>Wrong. Academic PDFs are messy. Extract text and you get dozens of co-author names, chart numbers, table data, footnotes - everything my friend didn‚Äôt want to hear.</p>

<p>I tried asking different AIs to extract only title, abstract, and main content:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Claude Sonnet: Failed</li>
  <li>Grok: Failed with errors</li>
  <li>Claude Opus: Success</li>
</ul>

<p>Turns out extracting clean content from academic PDFs is harder than expected.</p>

<h2 id="from-manual-to-automated">From Manual to Automated</h2>

<p>I generated the MP3 using Azure TTS and made a tutorial video. But a week later, my friend was still hunting for paid PDF-to-speech services.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs when I realized: I might not know the perfect PDF-to-text AI, but I can definitely build a basic TTS web app.</p>

<p>So I coded one with Claude Sonnet, built it in Next.js, deployed on Vercel, and shared it.</p>

<p>This is why I love being able to code!!!</p>

# I Mined ETH in 2021, and Here's Why You Probably Shouldn't

> **Note**: *This post is based on my original Korean blog entries from 2021, translated and expanded for English readers.*

## TL;DR
- **Hardware**: Gaming laptop with NVIDIA RTX 3060
- **Hash rate**: 37-40 MH/s average
- **Peak earnings**: ~$180/month (May 2021)
- **Current earnings**: ~$60-70/month (Dec 2021)
- **Temperature**: 66-74¬∞C with proper cooling
- **Verdict**: Worth it if you have good GPU specs and idle time

## How It All Started

Earlier this year, I was looking for a new laptop for trading stocks and music production (FL Studio). As a MacBook Air user who occasionally boots into Windows for banking, I needed something more powerful.

While browsing for high-spec laptops, I came across this viral image of Chinese laptop mining farms:

That's when it hit me: *"Why not mine when the laptop is idle?"*

## The Setup Process

### Hardware Specs
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3060 (laptop version)
- **Mining software**: PhoenixMiner
- **Pool**: Ethermine

### Getting Started
After watching YouTube tutorials and connecting my wallet to Ethermine, I finally got my mining rig running. I even named my mining worker "Dobby"

## Mining Performance & Earnings

### Hash Rate Performance
The RTX 3060 laptop consistently delivers **37-40 MH/s**, which is pretty solid for a laptop GPU.

### Earnings Timeline

**May 2021 (Peak ETH prices):**
- Expected monthly earnings: ~$180
- Thought: *"I'll recover the laptop cost in just a few months!"*

**December 2021 (Reality check):**
- Monthly earnings: $60-70
- ETH price crashed to 1/3 of peak values

## Temperature Management

### Normal Operation
- **Temperature range**: 66-74¬∞C
- **Fan noise**: Noticeable but not overly annoying
- **Setup**: Laptop on a stand (crucial for airflow)

### The Dust Crisis
A few weeks ago, temperatures spiked to **80¬∞C+**! 

Upon inspection, the laptop was clogged with dust. Had to:
1. Disassemble the back panel
2. Clean the fans thoroughly
3. Reassemble everything

*Warning: Dusty fan photos ahead!*

Post-cleaning, temperatures returned to normal ranges.

## Power Consumption & Costs

While I haven't seen the electricity bill impact yet, the laptop draws reasonable power for a mining setup. The convenience of having an all-in-one device outweighs desktop alternatives.

## Is Laptop Mining Worth It?

### ‚úÖ **Pros:**
- **Passive income** while laptop is idle
- **No additional hardware** needed (monitor, keyboard, etc.)
- **Compact setup** compared to desktop rigs
- **Learning experience** about blockchain technology

### ‚ùå **Cons:**
- **Volatile earnings** based on crypto prices
- **Heat generation** requires proper cooling
- **Fan noise** during operation
- **Potential hardware wear** over time

## **My Recommendation**

**Yes, if you have:**
- High-end GPU (RTX 3060 or better)
- Significant idle time
- Proper cooling setup
- Realistic expectations about earnings

**No, if you:**
- Expect guaranteed profits
- Can't tolerate fan noise
- Have poor GPU specs
- Need the laptop for intensive tasks

## Looking Forward

With Ethereum's upcoming changes and potential shift to Proof of Stake, mining profitability will likely decrease further. However, the experience has been valuable for understanding:
- Cryptocurrency mechanics
- Hardware optimization
- Market volatility

The ETH I've mined is staying in my wallet for now - treating it as a long-term investment rather than immediate income.

## **Update: The Luna Disaster**

*Note: Later invested mining proceeds in Luna-related tokens... which didn't end well. Crypto lesson learned the hard way!*

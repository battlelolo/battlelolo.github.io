# My Ongoing Online AI Business: The Story of AI PEPEGO

Following my series on failed ventures, I'd like to introduce you to my "ongoing" business.

When I started building this product, honestly, no one around me thought I could make money from it. Nobody believed people would actually pay for this service.

## The Pain Point That Started It All

It all began with my own frustration. As a non-native English speaker who uses English professionally, I understand how challenging it can be for Korean native speakers to follow English speeches or lectures in real-time.

The biggest problem with existing free AI translation tools (Google Translate, DeepL, Naver Papago) was that they would lose track after recognizing and translating just a few sentences when dealing with longer speeches. While they work fine for short conversations - like talking to a foreigner - they become useless for lengthy content like foreign language lectures or speeches.

Recent LLM models can do speech recognition, but they don't provide real-time translation. Or when they do speech recognition, they tend to ignore what you're saying when responding.

As someone who invests in US stocks, I often need to listen to speeches by the US President or Federal Reserve Chairman. I can't count how many times I wished for a tool that could listen and translate simultaneously in real-time.

## Building the Solution

So I built it - a tool that provides real-time speech recognition and simultaneous interpretation for over an hour. I named it "PEPEGO," inspired by Naver's Papago, with a penguin face as the logo.

This was my first time implementing payment functionality with my business registration, which came with many challenges. To add payment features to a web app, you need approval from payment platforms.

First, I needed a Korean business registration. For payment methods, I eventually integrated LemonSqueezy and Toss Pay. I also applied for KakaoPay in the middle of development, but since it was taking longer than expected, I went with Toss Pay, which only took a few days. I planned to add KakaoPay later, but due to various circumstances, I never did.

## Marketing and Results

For post-launch marketing, I focused on content marketing - uploading videos to blogs, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook. Perhaps due to the specific nature of language tools, once uploaded, these videos consistently gained views and brought in users over time.

I tried paid marketing on Instagram and Facebook, but the performance marketing results weren't as good as expected.

The results: Over 1,100 unique visitors, 70+ signups, and several paying customers.

## Was This a Failure?

Is this small number a failure? Was building this product a mistake?

I don't want to call it a failure. It's a product that still generates revenue without any ongoing effort from me. More importantly, it gave me invaluable inspiration for building SaaS products online.

## Looking Forward

Moving forward, I'm committed to creating better, more profitable products that truly help people and make a positive impact on the world.

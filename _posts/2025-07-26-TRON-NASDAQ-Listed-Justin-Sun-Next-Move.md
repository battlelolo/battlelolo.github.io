# TRON NASDAQ Listed: Justin Sun's Next Move?

## Twitter Discovery

Scrolling Twitter when "TRON listing" hit trending topics. Clicked to see what's up.

**Turns out:** TRON officially listed on NASDAQ through reverse merger with SRM Entertainment. Justin Sun rang the opening bell himself in July 2025.

TRX trading volume jumped 36%+ after the news.



## Justin Sun's Greatest Hits

Speaking of Justin Sun, the guy's been crypto's biggest attention seeker for years. Let me list some of his legendary moments:

**The $6.2M Banana**  
Literally ate Maurizio Cattelan's expensive art piece. Peak performance art or peak cringe?

**Warren Buffett Lunch**  
Won $4.57M charity auction, then postponed due to "kidney stones." Eventually met Buffett privately.

**Blue Origin Space Seat**  
Bought a ticket on Jeff Bezos's space flight. Crypto's first space ambassador attempt.

**Trump Coin Promotions**  
Recently been pushing various Trump-related tokens, riding political waves.

**Citizenship Swap**  
Renounced Chinese citizenship for Saint Kitts and Nevis passport. Strategic move for global business.

## What's Next?

With TRON now on NASDAQ, I'm genuinely curious what Justin Sun's next big move will be.

The guy never fails to surprise the crypto world with his unconventional approach. Love him or hate him, he keeps things interesting.
